  My focus is on image-to-image translation, 3D neural rendering and multi-view image generation, particularly using synthetic data for tasks like 3D face reconstruction and landmark detection. Passionate about the potential of 2D & 3D data synthesis, I believe synthetic data will be pivotal in future tech developments.
  I am most skilled in: <mark>GAN</mark>, <mark>Diffusion model</mark> and <mark>3D neural rendering</mark>.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            Every company needs its networks properly administered and The Boring Compay is no exception. Digging holes is hard and I play my part making sure the whole company stays connected. I lead a team of 5 people and enjoy driving the company to try new technologies.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
