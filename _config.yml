about_content: |
  Hello, I'm Li Yuanming, currently a Ph.D. candidate in Artificial Intelligence at Korea University under the guidance of Hanseok Ko. You might find my educational journey intriguing due to the significant 'gap' between my undergraduate, master's, and doctoral fields. This gap reflects my 'important' choices.

  In my field, I focus on generative models like Generative Adversarial Networks (<mark>GAN</mark>), <mark>Diffusion model</mark>, and <mark>3D neural rendering</mark>. I've worked with 1D, 2D, and 3D data synthesis, and my current research mainly involves synthesizing 3D data from 2D sources. I have extensive experience in enhancing existing model performance through synthetic data generation.
